Instruction

Create an authentication API service with Passport package from PHP Lumen framework.



You will need to create a migration to insert a users table to the database.



Three endpoints are required as a result of this test.

1.  Register user

    Endpoint: {{url}}/api/register

    Body form data and rules:

     - first_name: required|string

     - last_name: required|string

     - email: required|email|unique

     - password: required|password

     - age: string



Note: It's an endpoint to register a user. Unique email checking is required.



2.  Login user

    Endpoint: {{url}}/api/login

    Body form data and rules:

         - email: required|email

         - password: required|password



Note: It's an endpoint to log in a user. Email existence and invalid password checking are required. This endpoint should return an auth token and user details.



3.  Get user details

    Endpoint: {{url}}/api/users/{{user_id}}

    Auth: Bearer {{auth_token}}



Note: It's an endpoint to retrieve user details. Valid auth token checking is required. Please create a middleware to verify auth token and apply it to this endpoint.



Please complete this within 2-3 days and commit your work to your own git repository and provide us the link once you are done.



If possible, please attach Postman screenshots for above endpoint results in your repository.



If you need more time, please do let us know.



PS: No frontend interface needed and it'd be great if you are able to deploy this service into your own hosting and provide us a public link. Anyway, this is optional.
